# School Consultation Booking System
This Web App aims to centralise booking of consultation time slots for both students and teachers.

Students can select the teachers they wish to consult, view the available time slots and place a booking. They can also check all their bookings they have made.

Teachers can set the available time slots and the maximum number of students for each session. They can also view their own consultation schedules.
